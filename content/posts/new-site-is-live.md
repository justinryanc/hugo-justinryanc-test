title: New Site Is Live
---

**An adventure and learning experience!**

I've used WordPress for at least a decade and man was it getting old.  If you've ever had a WordPress site you know far too well about the constant updates, security exploits, recurring licensing and hosting costs, etc.  I've tested static site generators for a few years and decided it was time to make the switch.

That's where Hugo comes in, it's a static generator that essentially builds your site from Markdown files and offers themes as well.  There are many ways to install and deploy a site with Hugo, I just chose the Azure based route since of course I'm an Azure guy.  I'll write another post in the coming days going in-depth.

I'm proud to go live with my new Hugo generated site today that was deployed using Azure DevOps and an Azure Static Web App.  I hope to publish lots of content in the coming days around technology and photography, for now enjoy the new site!
